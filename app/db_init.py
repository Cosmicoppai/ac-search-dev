    "😆 Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry."
    " Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,"
    " when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book."
    " It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged."
    " It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,"
    " and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
    "Why do we use it?It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content"
    " of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,"
    " as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English."
    " Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,"
    " and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,"
    " sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)."
